# typinggame

My first project in an edX JavaScript course. There are a few bugs and the UX is terrible, but I don't think it's worth spending more time on right now.

You start with a 7 second timer, a random word, and a box to type in. Each correct word gets 1 point and adds 2 seconds to the timer.
